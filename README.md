This project is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application designed as a social media-inspired platform where job seekers can write posts detailing tasks or jobs, and job providers can browse, search, sort, and filter these posts. Users interact in a dynamic environment where job providers can show interest in tasks that suit their pay expectations, schedule, equipment, and available resources.

Unique features include the ability for users to negotiate pay, request exact job locations (only available upon seeker approval, as posts display a general location by default), and verify each otherâ€™s credibility through mutual reviews provided after each completed job. Future updates will also integrate personal chat, allowing users to communicate directly. This project is still in its early stages, with many more features planned.
